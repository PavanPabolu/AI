Subject: Permission to Allow [Friend's Name] to Pick Up My Child

Dear [Principal's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to seek permission to allow my friend, [Friend's Name], to pick up my child, [Child's Name], from school on my behalf. Due to personal circumstances, I am unable to personally collect my child from school during the specified time.

I trust [Friend's Name] completely and consider them responsible and trustworthy. They have been a close friend for many years and have a good rapport with my child. I am confident that they will ensure the safety and well-being of my child during the transition from school to home.

To facilitate the process, I kindly request the school's approval for [Friend's Name] to be added to the authorized pick-up list for my child. I assure you that all necessary precautions will be taken, and proper identification will be provided by my friend when picking up my child.

I understand the importance of maintaining the security and safety of all students, and I appreciate the school's diligence in adhering to these protocols. If there are any specific procedures or forms that need to be completed for this arrangement, please let me know, and I will promptly fulfill any requirements.

I am grateful for your understanding and cooperation in this matter. Should you have any concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at your convenience.

Thank you for your attention to this request, and I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
