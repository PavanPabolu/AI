Subject: Request for Closing Kotak Credit Card - Unable to Bear Annual Charges, No Offers, and Redemption of Rewards Points

Dear Kotak Credit Card Customer Service,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request the closure of my Kotak Credit Card [Card Number]. After careful consideration and evaluation of my financial situation, I have come to the decision that I am no longer able to bear the annual charges associated with the card. Additionally, I have noticed a lack of attractive offers and benefits that align with my spending patterns and needs, further reinforcing my decision to close the card.

Before proceeding with the closure, I would like to inquire about the redemption of any accrued rewards points on my Kotak Credit Card. I believe I have accumulated a significant amount of rewards points through my usage of the card. Kindly provide information on how I can redeem these points or if there are any options available to transfer them to another loyalty program or account.

Once I have received the necessary information regarding the redemption of rewards points, I kindly request you to initiate the closure process for my Kotak Credit Card. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with the necessary steps and any additional information required to complete this procedure.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the services provided by Kotak Credit Card during my tenure as a customer. While the annual charges and lack of attractive offers have prompted my decision to close the card, I am grateful for the rewards points accumulated throughout my usage.

Please confirm the closure of my Kotak Credit Card account, ensuring the cancellation is processed without any outstanding dues or fees on the account. Additionally, I kindly request that any rewards points be redeemed or transferred as per the provided information.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Should you require any further information or documentation from my end, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
