Dear Intellipaat Team,

Greetings! I appreciate the chance you have offered to share my success story and participate in the opportunity to win an iPad or iPhone. However, I must clarify that I have taken a break in completing the course due to an increased workload with my office responsibilities. Regrettably, I have not been able to complete the course as of yet.

Intellipaat has provided valuable learning resources and I have benefitted from the knowledge and skills acquired thus far. However, due to the demands of my current workload, I have not been able to allocate sufficient time to complete the course as intended.

While I am unable to share a success story at this moment, I truly value the learning experience with Intellipaat and hope to resume my course once my work responsibilities permit. I appreciate your understanding in this matter.

Thank you for considering my participation, and I apologize for any inconvenience caused. I wish the best of luck to all the participants in sharing their success stories.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
